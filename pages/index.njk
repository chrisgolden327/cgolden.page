            This is the homepage of Chris Golden! I am a senior at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
            I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering along with a minor in music. This blog site is
            a place for me to share my engineering projects, music, photography, and other interests.

            This website is a work in progress and was begun during January of 2021. More posts will be added about past and current projects
            as time allows. For my most up to date resume or my linkedin, please see above. Or if you want to reach me directly, my 
            university email is provided as well.
