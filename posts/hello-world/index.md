### Hello, World
This website was started during January of 2021 as a personal project to help display some of my accomplishments as an engineering student at The Ohio State University, as well as learn and explore more areas of programming and scripting. I was helped by my friend and roommate Matthew Hall, a computer science and engineering student at Ohio State. He designed Neanderthal, a system for building your own personal website or blog. Learn more about [Neanderthal](https://github.com/MH15/neanderthal) or check out his [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-hall-osu/).
