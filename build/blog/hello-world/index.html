        <h3>Hello, World</h3>
<p>This website was started during January of 2021 as a personal project to help display some of my accomplishments as an engineering student at The Ohio State University, as well as learn and explore more areas of programming and scripting. I was helped by my friend and roommate Matthew Hall, a computer science and engineering student at Ohio State. He designed Neanderthal, a system for building your own personal website or blog. Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/MH15/neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> or check out his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-hall-osu/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
